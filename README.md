# The-Scrolling-Game

For this project, I created a startup simulator. The main objective is to collect money so that they can be successful. The person can choose the initial difficulty and they can only go faster. In other words, they can not get slower than the difficulty. Another thing that I added is once the user hits a certain score (100) then another obstacle is added and the speed (difficulty) increases permanently.
